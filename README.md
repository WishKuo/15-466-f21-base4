# A Composer's Life

Author: Wish Kuo

Design: 
It is not working :(
Just run out of the time due to falling off from a scooter last Friday and hardly be able to type until today.
My recent thought was to rebuild a game according to a short experience made for the other class last year.

Text Drawing: (TODO: how does the text drawing in this game work? Is text precomputed? Rendered at runtime? What files or utilities are involved?)

Screen Shot:

How To Play:
Recent thought:
Use Up/Down arrow to switch the choice and the final composed music will be different regarding to your choices.
