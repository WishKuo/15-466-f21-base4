# A Composer's Life

Author: Wish Kuo

Design: <br>
It is not working :( <br>
Just run out of the time due to falling off from a scooter last Friday and hardly be able to type until today. <br>
My recent thought was to rebuild a game according to a short experience made for the other class last year. <br>
The Demo Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hq0_6s_Czk&ab_channel=VisualStory

Text Drawing: (TODO: how does the text drawing in this game work? Is text precomputed? Rendered at runtime? What files or utilities are involved?)

Screen Shot:

How To Play: <br>
Recent thought:<br>
Use Up/Down arrow to switch the choice and the final composed music will be different regarding to your choices.
